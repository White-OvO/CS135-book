Program Entry Point - The starting point of program execution, defined as main().

Sequential Execution - The order in which statements are executed, from top to bottom/left to right.

Block of Code - A structured group of statements that execute as a unit.

Semicolon (;) - Marks the end of a statement in C++.

Compiler - A tool that translates source code into machine code.

Preprocessor Directive - Special instructions in a programming language, primarily used in C and C++, that are executed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation of the program begins.

Preprocessor - A tool that processes source code before compilation by handling directives (e.g., #include, #define) for file inclusion, macro substitution, and conditional compilation.

Linker - Combines object files with necessary libraries.

Loader - Loads the compiled program into memory for execution.
